## Requirements
* Docker version 20.10.x, or later
* docker-compose version 1.22.x

### Memory requirements
* Required: at least 6GB of RAM
* Required: 10G or higher of HDD

## Setup
```bssh
docker-compose up -d
```
It takes more than 20 minutes to pull the Docker image for the first time.

## Usage
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "sentence":"The answer is blown'\''in the wind.", 
    "lang":"en_US", 
    "extentInfoJson":"{}",
    "isNegativeSentence":false, 
}
' http://localhost:9007/analyzeOneSentence
```
Currently, isNegativeSentence is always set to false when registering data.

# Note
* This microservice uses 9007 as the default port.
* The meaning of premise is a premise as a proposition, and it corresponds to A of A â†’ B in a logical formula. Therefore, it is set when there is a condition for the claim. Unless there are special conditions, it is not necessary to set the premise.
